        <div class="grid-item"><p>Mark off a 4 foot by 8 foot area or frame out a 4 x 8 area using 2x4's or 4x4â€™s or
            2x6's, whatever suits you. Framing is unnecessary, but if you like to have a manicured look to your yard,
            frame. It helps when trimming the grass.</p>
            <p>Clear your 4x8 area of any weeds or grass by mowing the plot as short as possible and hoeing the area
                bare. This will prevent any established weeds breaking through the leaf compost mulch layer.</p>

                <li>2. Leaf compost mulch is food for earth worms and other organisms that live in the soil.</li>
                <li>3. Earthworms and other soil organisms till the soil so you don't have to. As long as you feed
                    them.
                </li>
                <li>4. Leaf compost mulch prevents weeds, retains moisture and regulates soil temperature.</li>
