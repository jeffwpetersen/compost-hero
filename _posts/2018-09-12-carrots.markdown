</li><li><span class="recipeStepsHeading">2.</span> <span class="recipeStepsBody">In a large skillet, heat 1 Tbsp Vegetable oil, 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar and the juice of one whole lemon.</span>
</li><li><span class="recipeStepsHeading">3.</span> <span class="recipeStepsBody">Bring skillet up to medium-high heat. When the oil and liquid is hot and steaming, add the carrots in a single layer and cover. Cook for 5 minutes. Uncover and cook another 5 minutes staring regularly to brown the carrots. Keep an eye on them as they should be developing a nice caramelization at this point. </span>
</li><li><span class="recipeStepsHeading">4.</span> <span class="recipeStepsBody">Add remaining ingredients and cook another 5 minutes or until the garlic and ginger are cooked and the sugar has glazed the caramelized carrots. </span>
