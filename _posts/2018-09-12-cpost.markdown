Leaf compost will help maintain moisture during drought conditions and organisms in the soil can use the leaves for food and in turn provide nutrients to the plants. Leaf compost can also be combined with natural wood chips to create a denser mulch effect. The leaves and wood chips will decompose together.</div>
