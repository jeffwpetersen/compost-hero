            Why leaf compost mulch? There is no better way to improve the health of your soil, and the health of your
            soil is the primary factor in the health of your garden. The percentage of organic matter in your soil
            matters. Incorporating leaf compost mulch into your garden will improve soil structure, fertilize and
            provide food for organisms in the <a href="http://www.jefflowenfels.com/books-by-jeff-lownfels/">soil food
            web.</a></h3>

                </h2>
                    Rain drops hitting clay and sand soils will dislodge particles and send them streaming off down hill
                    and causing erosion and compaction. Leaf compost used as mulch acts as a shield and prevents soil
                    degradation.

                <div class="grid-item"><h2><strong>Insulate soil</strong> from intense summer sunlight and prevent
                    evaporation.</h2>
                    Keeping roots cool in the heat will make for stronger healthier plants and increase yields in the
                    vegetable garden.

                    and organic carbon will absorb and retain water and prevent evaporation.

                    Weed seeds need sunlight to germinate. A layer of mulch in the spring denies seeds of sunlight.

                <h2><strong>Soil structure
                    air and water</strong></h2>
                <strong>Soil tilth or texture is determined by inorganic particle sizes that make up your soil.</strong>
                Organic matter prevents clumping and creates pores that allow for the movement of air and water.
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><h2>Soil organisms</h2>
                <strong>Living organisms are present in healthy soil with plenty of organic matter.</strong> Organic
                matter or humus is food for soil organisms from worms to protozoa. A multitude of hungry critters are
                moving around in your soil looking for their next meal. During this process these organisms churn the
                soil, break up soil particles and improve soil tilth.
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><h2>Roots and symbiosis</h2>
                <strong>The roots of some varieties of plants create symbiotic relationships with fungi.</strong> These
                mycorrhizal fungi feed on the decaying organic matter in the soil and mineral nutrients left behind.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="style strong"><h2>Nutrients</h2>Leaf compost contains all the nutrients plants require except
            nitrogen. Nutrients contained in leaf compost are converted to plant available nutrients by the organisms
            responsible for organic decomposition.
        </div>
        <div class="style strong padding-bottom padding-top"><h2>Soil pH</h2>
            Leaf compost mulch neutralizes soil pH levels. During the initial stages of compost decomposition, organic
            acids are formed. The acidic conditions are favorable for growth of fungi and breakdown of lignin and
            cellulose. As composting proceeds, the organic acids become neutralized. Mature leaf compost mulch has a pH
            of around 6.5.
